Traffic Flow Prediction using Deep Learning
â€¢	Developed an innovative traffic flow prediction system tailored for smart cities' traffic management infrastructure. Using the power of Multi-layered Perceptron neural networks, the system analyzes
  historical traffic data, such as traffic volume, time of day, weather conditions, and special events, to forecast future traffic patterns accurately.
  This model helps in de-congesting real-time traffic by taking up traffic management strategies.
